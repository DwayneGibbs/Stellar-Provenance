# **Stellar Provenance**  
### *A Web3 Space Explorer Game Powered by Real Astronomical Data*

---

## 🚀 The Vision

**Explore. Discover. Name. Own. Contribute.**

Stellar Provenance is an open-source Web3 space exploration game where players discover, name, and map real celestial bodies from open astronomical datasets (Gaia, SkyMapper, TESS), mint those discoveries as blockchain-backed NFTs, and help advance citizen science—all while building a persistent, player-owned universe.

This isn't a passive database. This is a **playable, immersive experience** where every discovery matters, every name becomes part of history, and every explorer shapes the future of space.

---

## 🌌 What You'll Actually Do

**In Stellar Provenance, you will:**

- 🔭 **Explore real celestial data** from open, globally-recognized astronomical sources  
- 🎯 **Discover and name** stars, planets, moons, and exoplanets before anyone else  
- ⛓️ **Mint discoveries as NFTs** on Ethereum (or L2 networks), creating immutable records of your exploration  
- 🗺️ **Map celestial bodies** with scientific metadata (coordinates, magnitude, spectral type) aligned with IAU standards  
- 🧬 **Contribute to citizen science** by classifying real astronomical data and validating player discoveries  
- 🏆 **Earn rewards** through exploration, naming, and community governance participation  
- 🎭 **Co-create lore and narrative** that ties real science to fictional discovery  
- 🤝 **Govern together** with the community on naming disputes, platform evolution, and scientific priorities

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

The gameplay draws from the rich traditions of space exploration games while grounding every discovery in real, verifiable astronomical data:

- **Discovery Scanner**: Scan open-source celestial catalogs to find unexplored objects
- **Full Spectrum Analysis**: Analyze real observational data (photometry, astrometry) from SkyMapper and other providers
- **Naming Rights**: Mint blockchain records of your discoveries; your name becomes permanently associated with each object
- **Citizen Science Tasks**: Participate in real scientific workflows—classify anomalies, validate exoplanet candidates, flag interesting objects for researchers
- **Community Validation**: Vote on naming proposals and dispute resolution through tokenized governance
- **Rewards & Progression**: Earn tokens, NFTs, and reputation for discoveries, scientific contributions, and governance participation

## 🧬 Scientific Credibility + Community Power

We're not building a "name a star" novelty service. Stellar Provenance is designed from the ground up to:

1. **Align with scientific standards** – Metadata follows IAU conventions and Virtual Observatory protocols
2. **Respect existing authorities** – All names are symbolic and complementary to official IAU designations
3. **Leverage open data** – We use freely available, CC-licensed data from global astronomy initiatives
4. **Enable citizen science** – Players contribute real-world annotations and classifications that researchers can use
5. **Ensure provenance** – Blockchain immutably records the chain of discovery, validation, and contribution

This creates a **dual value system**: entertainment for players, scientific value for researchers.

## 🧭 Project Goals

- Build a **playable Web3 game** that makes space exploration engaging and rewarding
- Create a **decentralized registry** of player-discovered and named celestial objects
- Integrate **open astronomical datasets** (Gaia, SkyMapper, TESS, SDSS)
- Enable **blockchain-based ownership** through NFTs and immutable provenance records
- Support **citizen science workflows** that benefit real astronomical research
- Foster a **community-governed platform** where players shape evolution and priorities
- Demonstrate that **games and science aren't mutually exclusive**—they can amplify each other

## 🛠️ Current Status

Stellar Provenance is in its **early development phase** (docs-first, pre-MVP). This repository currently includes:

- Conceptual whitepapers and research notes
- Community strategy and roadmap planning
- Vision and architectural concepts
- Foundation for technical development

As the project evolves, this repository will expand to include:

- Smart contract prototypes (ERC-721 for discovery NFTs, governance tokens)
- Game world and data schemas
- API specifications for celestial data integration
- Frontend (Web3 DApp) and backend components
- Contribution guidelines and governance frameworks

---

## 🌍 Community First

Stellar Provenance is built with a **community-first philosophy**. We're looking for:

- **Game Developers** – Build the exploration interface and gameplay loops
- **Smart Contract Engineers** – Design ownership, governance, and reward mechanisms
- **Astronomers & Data Scientists** – Ensure scientific accuracy and data integration
- **Web3 Builders** – Implement token economics, governance, and NFT infrastructure
- **Designers & Artists** – Create immersive UI, celestial visualizations, and narrative experiences
- **Storytellers** – Co-author the lore and connect player discoveries to fictional narratives
- **Citizen Scientists** – Help design real scientific tasks that players can contribute to

If you're passionate about space, decentralization, open science, or gaming—we need you.
