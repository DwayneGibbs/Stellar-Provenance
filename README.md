**Stellar Provenance** is an open, community‑driven initiative to create a decentralized registry of celestial discoveries—real or simulated—powered by open astronomical data and blockchain technology. The project aims to democratize space exploration by allowing individuals to symbolically name, annotate, and preserve celestial objects on an immutable ledger while contributing to scientific engagement and public understanding of astronomy.

This repository serves as the foundation for the platform’s development, documentation, and community collaboration.

## 🚀 Vision

Humanity has always looked to the stars for meaning, inspiration, and discovery. Yet the process of naming and cataloging celestial bodies remains centralized and inaccessible to the public. Stellar Provenance introduces a new model:

- **Open participation** in symbolic naming and mapping  
- **Transparent provenance** through blockchain records  
- **Community governance** to ensure quality and collaboration  
- **Scientific alignment** through open data and citizen science opportunities  

Our goal is to build a shared cosmic commons—one that blends exploration, creativity, and scientific value.

## 🧭 Project Goals

- Create a **public, decentralized registry** of celestial objects  
- Enable users to **symbolically name** stars, planets, moons, and other bodies  
- Integrate **open astronomical datasets** (e.g., Gaia, SkyMapper, TESS)  
- Provide **immutable provenance** using blockchain technology  
- Support **citizen science** through annotation, classification, and discovery tasks  
- Build a **community‑first ecosystem** of explorers, scientists, and creators
