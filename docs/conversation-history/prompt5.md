# **Stellar Provenance: A Decentralized Framework for Naming and Mapping Celestial Discoveries**

## Executive Summary

The cosmos is vast, dynamic, and increasingly accessible through open astronomical data and immersive digital experiences. Yet, the process of naming and cataloging celestial bodies remains centralized, opaque, and disconnected from the public imagination. This white paper proposes a decentralized, blockchain-powered platform that allows individuals to symbolically name and map celestial objects—real or simulated—while contributing to scientific discovery, data provenance, and public engagement.

By combining open astronomical datasets, Web3 infrastructure, and community-driven governance, this initiative aims to create a persistent, transparent, and participatory registry of celestial discoveries. The result is not just a game or a database—it’s a new paradigm for citizen astronomy and digital legacy.

## Problem Statement

- **Centralized Naming Authority**: The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is the sole authority for officially naming celestial bodies, but its process is closed to the public and limited in scope.
- **Lack of Provenance in Public Naming Services**: Commercial “name a star” services offer symbolic naming without scientific legitimacy or traceability.
- **Underutilized Open Data**: Vast astronomical datasets (e.g., from Gaia, SkyMapper, TESS) remain inaccessible or underused by the general public.
- **Missed Engagement Opportunities**: The public’s fascination with space is not being harnessed to support real scientific efforts or data validation.

---

## Vision

To build a decentralized platform where:
- Anyone can symbolically name or annotate celestial objects using real or simulated data.
- All naming events are immutably recorded on a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum).
- The platform aligns with scientific standards for metadata, coordinates, and provenance.
- Community governance ensures quality, prevents spam, and rewards meaningful contributions.
- Scientists can tap into this system for citizen science, anomaly detection, and public outreach.

## System Architecture

### 1. **Celestial Object Registry**
- Ingests data from open astronomical catalogs (e.g., Gaia, SkyMapper, SDSS).
- Supports both real and procedurally generated objects.
- Each object is assigned a unique identifier and metadata schema (coordinates, magnitude, spectral type, etc.).

### 2. **Blockchain Layer**
- Ethereum smart contracts mint symbolic naming rights as NFTs.
- Metadata includes:
  - Object ID and coordinates
  - Discoverer’s wallet address
  - Timestamp and optional lore
- Supports interoperability with decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Arweave).

### 3. **Community Governance**
- Token-based or reputation-based voting on name validity and lore contributions.
- Dispute resolution mechanisms for duplicate or inappropriate names.
- Optional staking to prevent spam and incentivize quality.

### 4. **Scientific Integration**
- APIs for researchers to access annotated data.
- Optional modules for citizen science tasks (e.g., classifying light curves, flagging anomalies).
- Provenance tracking for public contributions to scientific datasets.

## Use Cases

| Use Case | Description | Benefit |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Symbolic Naming | Users mint names for celestial objects | Creates emotional connection and digital legacy |
| Citizen Science | Players classify or annotate real data | Supports research and data validation |
| Lore Creation | Community builds a shared universe | Enhances engagement and storytelling |
| Scientific Outreach | Scientists publish challenges or missions | Bridges public interest with real research |

---

## Technical Stack (Proposed)

- **Frontend**: React + Web3.js or Ethers.js
- **Backend**: Node.js + GraphQL API
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Polygon or Optimism for scalability)
- **Storage**: IPFS for metadata, Arweave for permanence
- **Data Sources**: Gaia DR3, SkyMapper, TESS, Virtual Observatory APIs

---

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- **IAU Compliance**: Names minted on the platform are symbolic and explicitly not official IAU designations.
- **Data Licensing**: All astronomical data used will be sourced from open-access, Creative Commons-compatible datasets.
- **Privacy**: No personal data is stored on-chain; user identities are pseudonymous unless voluntarily disclosed.
