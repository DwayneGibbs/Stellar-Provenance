> I need you to think like an Engineer and Scientist to identify if Elite Dangerous allows a person to name stars, planets, moons, etc. and then identify if a project has been started or created, or a software application has been started or created, or process is in place that takes these names and allows a user to publish to a Blockchain like Ethereum. If no project is found that allows the publishing to the Ethereum blockchain with regards to these names, then I need you to continue to think like an Engineer, Scientist, and Business Expert to identify if it is possible to develop a process that allows players of Elite Dangerous to map and name the stars, planets, moons, etc. as they play the game and push their findings on a blockchain and do it in a way that is recognized by the Space industry?


# Elite Dangerous Naming, Blockchain Integration, and the Feasibility of a Discovery-to-Blockchain Platform

---

## Introduction

The intersection of digital exploration, user-generated discovery, and blockchain technology is a rapidly evolving frontier. Elite Dangerous, a massively multiplayer space simulation, offers players the opportunity to explore a procedurally generated Milky Way galaxy, discover new celestial bodies, and contribute to a shared universe. This report investigates whether Elite Dangerous allows players to name stars, planets, moons, or other celestial bodies, and whether any existing projects or software enable users to publish such names or discoveries to a blockchain, specifically Ethereum. If no such project exists, the report evaluates the feasibility of developing a process or platform that allows Elite Dangerous players to map and name celestial bodies during gameplay and publish these findings to a blockchain. The analysis considers technical, legal, and industry recognition aspects, including the potential for smart contracts, metadata standards, and interoperability with existing astronomical databases or registries. The report is structured into four main sections: (1) Elite Dangerous naming capabilities, (2) existing blockchain integration projects, (3) feasibility of a new system, and (4) potential for space industry recognition.

## 1. Elite Dangerous In-Game Discovery and Naming Mechanics

### 1.1. Discovery and Mapping in Elite Dangerous

Elite Dangerous is renowned for its vast, procedurally generated galaxy, which closely mirrors the real Milky Way in both scale and structure. Players, known as Commanders, can embark on exploration journeys, scanning and mapping stars, planets, and moons. The game’s exploration mechanics are built around several key tools:

- **Discovery Scanner**: Scans an entire star system, instantly revealing all stars. If a player is the first to scan an uncharted star and sells the data, they receive a "First Discovered By" tag on the system map.
- **Full Spectrum System Scanner (FSS)**: Scans the system for planets, moons, asteroid belts, and signal sources. First discoveries are similarly credited.
- **Detailed Surface Scanner (DSS)**: Allows for detailed mapping of planets and moons. The first player to map a body receives a "First Mapped By" tag.
- **First Footfall**: With the Odyssey expansion, players can land on certain planets and moons. The first to set foot on a previously unvisited body is awarded the "First Footfall" tag.

These achievements are visible to all players in the system map and serve as a permanent record of a player’s pioneering efforts.

### 1.2. Naming Rights and Limitations

Despite the extensive recognition system for first discoveries, **Elite Dangerous does not allow players to assign custom names to stars, planets, moons, or other celestial bodies**. All systems and bodies are pre-named by the game’s procedural generation engine, known as the Galactic Forge. The naming conventions are systematic, often reflecting sector coordinates and star classifications, but they are not user-editable.

When a player discovers or maps a body for the first time, their Commander name is attached to that body as the discoverer or mapper. However, the body retains its procedural name (e.g., "Puelio CD-I C 23-2 1"). This design choice is intentional, as allowing custom names could lead to issues with offensive, copyrighted, or immersion-breaking content, as discussed in community forums and by the developers.

#### Table: In-Game Discovery Tags in Elite Dangerous

| Discovery Type                | Tag Awarded           | Visibility to Other Players | Naming Rights |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| First to Discover Star        | "First Discovered By" | Yes                         | No            |
| First to Discover Planet/Moon | "First Discovered By" | Yes                         | No            |
| First to Map Planet/Moon      | "First Mapped By"     | Yes                         | No            |
| First to Land on Planet/Moon  | "First Footfall"      | Yes                         | No            |

The table above summarizes the recognition system in Elite Dangerous. While players receive public credit for their discoveries, the actual names of celestial bodies remain fixed and are not subject to user modification.

### 1.3. Community Discussions and Official Stance

Community discussions on platforms such as Reddit and the official Frontier forums consistently confirm that **all systems and bodies are pre-named by Frontier Developments**. Players have expressed a desire for custom naming, but concerns about moderation, immersion, and potential abuse have led to a consensus against implementing such a feature. The developers have occasionally renamed systems for lore or gameplay reasons, but these changes are rare and typically tied to in-game events or narrative developments.

Some community members have suggested allowing personal bookmarks or local renaming for individual players, but these would not be visible to others and do not constitute official naming rights.

### 1.4. Third-Party Tools and Data Sharing

While Elite Dangerous does not permit custom naming, a robust ecosystem of third-party tools exists to enhance exploration and data sharing:

- **EDDiscovery**: Tracks player journeys, logs discoveries, and syncs with community databases such as EDSM (Elite Dangerous Star Map) and Inara.
- **EDSM**: A community-driven database that aggregates exploration data, including first discoveries and mapped bodies, but adheres to the in-game naming conventions.
- **Inara**: Provides APIs for updating Commander profiles and exploration logs, but does not support custom naming of celestial bodies.

These tools facilitate data sharing and community engagement but do not circumvent the core limitation: **no custom naming of celestial bodies is possible within the Elite Dangerous ecosystem**.

## 2. Existing Blockchain Integration Projects for Celestial Naming and Discovery

### 2.1. Overview of Blockchain in Astronomy and Naming

Blockchain technology has been explored in various domains for its potential to provide immutable, transparent, and decentralized records. In the context of astronomy and celestial naming, several projects and platforms have emerged, aiming to leverage blockchain’s strengths for data provenance, ownership, and public engagement. However, **no project currently integrates directly with Elite Dangerous gameplay or its discovery data**.

### 2.2. Notable Blockchain Projects Related to Celestial Naming

#### 2.2.1. Astro Ledger

**Astro Ledger** is a web3 project that allows users to name asteroids and other celestial bodies, recording these names on a decentralized blockchain ledger. The platform issues NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as proof of naming, ensuring that each name is unique, permanent, and verifiable on the blockchain. Astro Ledger emphasizes public engagement and aims to fund space grants through its naming activities.

- **Key Features**:
  - Naming of asteroids and celestial bodies.
  - Immutable records on blockchain (NFTs).
  - Public participation and awareness campaigns.
  - No scientific or industry recognition of names.

#### 2.2.2. Staracle

**Staracle** offers a similar service, allowing users to dedicate stars, galaxies, nebulae, or star clusters and receive an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain as proof of dedication. The platform uses a custom smart contract (ERC-721 standard) to guarantee uniqueness and tradability of each named object. Staracle explicitly states that these names are not recognized by the scientific community or official astronomical bodies.

- **Key Features**:
  - NFT-based naming of bright stars and deep-sky objects.
  - ERC-721 compliance for interoperability with NFT marketplaces.
  - High-quality certificates and digital assets.
  - No official or scientific recognition.

#### 2.2.3. Astrochain

**Astrochain** is a decentralized platform focused on creating a blockchain database of astronomy captures, promoting education, scientific research, and innovation. The platform includes a decentralized catalog subsystem that stores linked data of astronomical objects on the blockchain. While Astrochain supports the recording and sharing of astronomical observations, it does not provide a mechanism for naming celestial bodies discovered in video games like Elite Dangerous.

- **Key Features**:
  - Decentralized catalog of astronomical objects.
  - Integration with web and mobile apps.
  - Focus on education and decentralized science (DeSci).
  - No direct support for in-game discoveries or naming.

#### 2.2.4. SkyMapper

**SkyMapper** is a real-time, decentralized astronomy platform that connects a global network of telescopes and all-sky cameras. The platform uses blockchain technology to secure observational data, ensuring provenance and traceability. SkyMapper supports real-time alerts, collaborative discovery, and public participation, but its focus is on real-world astronomical observations rather than virtual discoveries in games.

- **Key Features**:
  - Blockchain-verified observational data.
  - Real-time sky monitoring and alerts.
  - Community-driven data contribution.
  - No support for virtual or game-based discoveries.

#### 2.2.5. TruSat (ConsenSys Space)

**TruSat** is an open-source, Ethereum-based system for tracking satellite orbital positions and space debris. It enables citizen scientists to contribute observations, which are recorded on a distributed ledger for transparency and trust. TruSat’s focus is on satellite tracking rather than celestial naming, and it does not interface with Elite Dangerous or similar games.

#### 2.2.6. Other Projects

- **SpaceChain**: Integrates blockchain nodes with satellites, enabling secure data storage and multi-tenant applications in space. Focuses on infrastructure rather than naming.
- **NASA SensorWeb**: Explores the use of Ethereum smart contracts for interoperable satellite sensor networks, not for naming or discovery attribution.
- **GitHub Repositories**: Projects such as "astronomical-ownership-matrix-contracts" and "star_registry_blockchain" demonstrate smart contract frameworks for decentralized ownership or registration of astronomical entities, but these are either experimental or educational and not widely adopted.

#### Table: Comparison of Blockchain Projects in Celestial Naming and Discovery

| Project Name        | Blockchain Platform | Purpose/Functionality                        | NFT/Token | Scientific Recognition | Integration with Games | Ethereum-Based |
|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Astro Ledger        | Not specified      | Naming asteroids, commemorative NFTs         | Yes       | No                    | No                    | Yes           |
| Staracle           | Ethereum           | NFT-based naming of stars, galaxies, nebulae | Yes       | No                    | No                    | Yes           |
| Astrochain         | Not specified      | Decentralized astronomy catalog              | No        | No                    | No                    | Not specified |
| SkyMapper          | Not specified      | Blockchain-verified observational data       | No        | Yes (data only)       | No                    | Not specified |
| TruSat             | Ethereum           | Satellite tracking, space debris ledger      | No        | No                    | No                    | Yes           |
| SpaceChain         | Qtum               | Satellite blockchain infrastructure          | No        | No                    | No                    | No            |
| Star Registry Blockchain | Bitcoin/Ethereum | Educational star registry demo             | No        | No                    | No                    | Yes           |

This table highlights that while several blockchain projects address celestial naming or data provenance, **none are integrated with Elite Dangerous or support the naming of in-game discoveries**. Most projects focus on real-world astronomical data or commemorative naming without scientific or industry recognition.

### 2.3. Metadata Standards and Interoperability

Projects like SkyMapper and Astrochain emphasize the importance of metadata standards for astronomical data. The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) has developed standards such as **VOEvent**, an XML-based schema for reporting astronomical events, which enables interoperability between observatories and data repositories. However, these standards are designed for real-world observations and are not directly applicable to virtual discoveries in games.

### 2.4. Smart Contracts and Tokenization

Ethereum smart contracts, particularly the ERC-721 (NFT) and ERC-1155 standards, are widely used for representing unique digital assets, including named stars or celestial objects. These standards ensure interoperability across wallets, marketplaces, and applications. Projects like Staracle leverage ERC-721 to guarantee uniqueness and tradability of named objects.

## 3. Feasibility of a New System: Mapping and Naming Elite Dangerous Discoveries on Blockchain

### 3.1. Technical Feasibility

#### 3.1.1. Data Extraction and Verification

Elite Dangerous maintains a comprehensive player journal system, which logs in-game events, discoveries, and exploration data. Third-party tools such as EDDiscovery, EDSM, and Inara already parse these journals to track player achievements and synchronize data with community databases. This infrastructure provides a foundation for extracting discovery data, including:

- System and body identifiers (procedural names).
- Commander name (discoverer).
- Timestamps of discovery or mapping.
- Additional metadata (e.g., scan values, mapping details).

A blockchain integration platform could leverage these logs to create verifiable records of in-game discoveries. However, **the inability to assign custom names remains a core limitation**.

#### 3.1.2. Blockchain Integration Architecture

A feasible architecture for publishing Elite Dangerous discoveries to a blockchain would involve:

- **Data Ingestion**: Parsing player journals for discovery events.
- **Verification**: Ensuring authenticity and preventing spoofing (e.g., by cross-referencing with EDSM or Inara APIs).
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Minting an NFT or recording a transaction on Ethereum (or a compatible chain) that includes:
  - The procedural name of the body.
  - The Commander’s identifier.
  - Timestamp and metadata.
  - Optional: a commemorative or personal name (not recognized in-game).
- **Metadata Storage**: Storing detailed metadata on IPFS or a similar decentralized storage solution to reduce on-chain costs.
- **User Interface**: Providing a web or mobile app for players to view, share, or trade their discovery NFTs.

#### 3.1.3. Smart Contract Standards

- **ERC-721**: Suitable for unique, non-fungible discovery tokens.
- **ERC-1155**: Allows batch minting and supports both fungible and non-fungible assets, potentially useful for large-scale discovery registries.
- **VOEvent/IVOA Metadata**: While not directly applicable, adopting similar structured metadata could enhance interoperability with astronomical databases.

#### 3.1.4. Anti-Spoofing and Data Provenance

Ensuring the authenticity of discovery claims is critical. Integration with trusted third-party APIs (e.g., EDSM, Inara) and cryptographic signing of journal data could mitigate spoofing risks. Timestamping and cross-verification with community databases would further enhance data integrity.

#### 3.1.5. Scalability and Cost

Ethereum mainnet transaction fees (gas costs) can be prohibitive for frequent or large-scale minting. Layer 2 solutions (e.g., Polygon) or alternative blockchains could reduce costs and improve scalability.

### 3.2. Legal and Policy Considerations

#### 3.2.1. Intellectual Property and Game Terms

Elite Dangerous is the intellectual property of Frontier Developments. The game’s End User License Agreement (EULA) and Terms of Service likely prohibit the commercial exploitation of in-game data or assets without explicit permission. Any platform that monetizes or publicizes in-game discoveries must ensure compliance with these terms to avoid legal liability.

#### 3.2.2. Space Law and Naming Rights

International space law, particularly the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, prohibits national appropriation of celestial bodies by claim of sovereignty. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is the recognized authority for naming celestial bodies in scientific contexts. The IAU allows public naming campaigns but maintains strict guidelines and does not recognize commercial or unofficial naming schemes.

- **IAU Naming Rules**:
  - Names must be non-offensive, unique, and not commercial.
  - No names of living individuals or entities with political, military, or religious significance.
  - Public names do not replace scientific designations and are recognized only for public use.

Any blockchain-based naming platform would have **no official standing in the scientific or space industry community**.

#### 3.2.3. Regulatory Compliance for Blockchain Registries

Blockchain registries and smart contracts must comply with relevant data protection, intellectual property, and consumer protection laws. The European Union’s GDPR, for example, poses challenges for immutable data storage, particularly regarding the "right to be forgotten". Projects must consider off-chain storage for personal data and implement privacy-preserving technologies.

#### 3.2.4. Industry Recognition and Integration

The space industry and scientific community recognize only names assigned through official channels (e.g., IAU). Blockchain-based naming platforms are viewed as commemorative or novelty services, with no impact on scientific nomenclature or databases.

### 3.3. Community Adoption and Incentives

A blockchain-based discovery registry could appeal to the Elite Dangerous community as a means of commemorating achievements, sharing discoveries, and participating in digital collectibles (NFTs). Incentives such as token rewards, community governance, and social features could drive adoption. However, the lack of in-game integration or official recognition may limit long-term engagement.

### 3.4. Technical and Governance Challenges

- **Data Authenticity**: Preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring only legitimate discoveries are recorded.
- **Scalability**: Managing large volumes of data without incurring excessive costs.
- **User Experience**: Designing intuitive interfaces for non-technical users.
- **Governance**: Establishing transparent, community-driven decision-making for naming conventions and dispute resolution.
- **Legal Risk**: Navigating intellectual property and regulatory constraints.

---

## 4. Potential for Space Industry and Scientific Recognition

### 4.1. Scientific Naming Conventions and Authority

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is the globally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies and features. The IAU’s processes are rigorous, involving scientific discovery, peer review, and adherence to established naming conventions. Public naming campaigns are occasionally conducted (e.g., NameExoWorlds), but names assigned through commercial or unofficial platforms are not recognized in scientific literature or databases.

- **IAU Guidelines**:
  - Names must be unique, non-commercial, and culturally appropriate.
  - Proposals are reviewed by committees and subject to international consensus.
  - Public names are credited but do not replace scientific designations.

### 4.2. Blockchain Registries and Industry Integration

While blockchain technology offers benefits for data provenance, transparency, and decentralized governance, its adoption in the space sector is nascent and focused primarily on supply chain management, satellite tracking, and data integrity. Projects like SkyMapper and TruSat demonstrate the potential for blockchain-verified observational data, but **no blockchain-based naming registry has been integrated with official astronomical databases or recognized by the IAU**.

- **Industry Adoption Barriers**:
  - Security and regulatory concerns favor permissioned (private) blockchains over public ledgers.
  - Lack of standardized protocols for naming and data interoperability.
  - Resistance from traditional institutions to unofficial naming schemes.

### 4.3. Legal and Policy Constraints

International treaties, such as the Outer Space Treaty, prohibit claims of ownership or sovereignty over celestial bodies. Naming rights are considered a matter of scientific convention rather than legal entitlement. Blockchain registries can provide immutable records of commemorative names, but these have **no legal or scientific standing**.

### 4.4. Metadata Standards and Interoperability

Adopting metadata standards such as VOEvent (for astronomical event reporting) could enhance interoperability with scientific databases, but only for real-world observations. Virtual discoveries in games like Elite Dangerous are not eligible for inclusion in official astronomical catalogs.

### 4.5. Case Studies and Precedents

- **Star Naming Services**: Commercial star naming services have existed for decades but are not recognized by the scientific community. Blockchain-based platforms like Staracle and Astro Ledger follow a similar model, offering commemorative naming with no official status.
- **SkyMapper**: Demonstrates successful integration of blockchain for data provenance in real-world astronomy, but does not support naming or virtual discoveries.
- **TruSat**: Engages citizen scientists in satellite tracking, recording data on Ethereum, but focuses on orbital data rather than naming.

---

## Conclusion

### Key Findings

- **Elite Dangerous does not allow players to name stars, planets, moons, or other celestial bodies**. All names are procedurally generated and fixed. Players receive public credit for first discoveries, mapping, and landings, but cannot assign custom names.
- **No existing project or software enables Elite Dangerous players to publish custom names or discoveries to a blockchain**. Several blockchain platforms support commemorative naming of real celestial objects (e.g., Astro Ledger, Staracle), but none integrate with Elite Dangerous or its data.
- **Developing a process or platform to map and name Elite Dangerous discoveries on blockchain is technically feasible**. Player journal data can be parsed, verified, and recorded on Ethereum or a compatible blockchain using smart contracts (ERC-721/1155). However, only procedural names can be recorded, and any custom naming would be unofficial and not reflected in-game.
- **Legal, policy, and industry recognition barriers are significant**. The IAU is the sole authority for scientific naming, and blockchain-based registries have no official standing. Intellectual property and game terms may restrict the use of in-game data for commercial or public registries.
- **Blockchain-based discovery registries could offer value as commemorative or collectible platforms** for the Elite Dangerous community, but would lack official recognition or integration with the space industry or scientific databases.

### Recommendations

- **For Developers**: Any blockchain integration should focus on commemorative recognition, leveraging NFTs and verifiable metadata, while clearly communicating the unofficial nature of the registry.
- **For Players**: Participation in blockchain-based discovery registries can enhance community engagement and personal achievement, but should not be confused with official naming or scientific recognition.
- **For the Space Industry**: Continued exploration of blockchain for data provenance, supply chain management, and observational integrity is warranted, but naming conventions should remain under the purview of established scientific authorities.

### Future Directions

- **In-Game Integration**: Collaboration with Frontier Developments could enable official support for blockchain-based achievement tracking, though custom naming is unlikely.
- **Metadata Standards**: Adoption of structured metadata (e.g., VOEvent) could facilitate interoperability with other registries and enhance data provenance.
- **Legal Frameworks**: Ongoing dialogue with legal experts and regulatory bodies is essential to ensure compliance and mitigate risks.
- **Community Governance**: Decentralized governance models (e.g., DAOs) could empower players to manage commemorative registries transparently.

| Community Adoption            | High                   | Moderate (niche)            | Potential                 | Limited                  |

---

## Final Assessment

While the technical foundation exists to create a blockchain-based registry for Elite Dangerous discoveries, **the inability to assign custom names in-game, combined with legal and industry constraints, means such a platform would serve only as an unofficial, commemorative record**. It could enhance community engagement and provide verifiable proof of discovery, but would not be recognized by the game, the scientific community, or the space industry. Any such initiative must be transparent about its unofficial status and ensure compliance with intellectual property and data protection laws. The broader potential of blockchain in astronomy lies in data provenance, collaborative observation, and decentralized governance, rather than in the naming of celestial bodies.
