### *Stellar Provenance — Research Summary & Foundational Insights*

---

## 📡 Overview

These research notes summarize the findings, insights, and conclusions gathered during the early exploration phase of the Stellar Provenance project. They cover naming conventions in astronomy, the role of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the status of blockchain‑based naming systems, the use of open astronomical data, and the feasibility of building a decentralized, community‑driven celestial registry.

This document serves as a reference for design decisions, white paper development, and community strategy.

## 🌠 1. Celestial Naming Standards & the IAU

### **IAU Authority**
- The **International Astronomical Union (IAU)** is the globally recognized authority for officially naming celestial bodies.
- Only the IAU can assign *official* names to stars, planets, moons, and other astronomical objects.
- Public naming services (e.g., “name a star” companies) are **symbolic only** and not recognized by the scientific community.

### **Public Participation**
- The IAU occasionally runs public naming campaigns (e.g., NameExoWorlds), but these are rare and tightly controlled.
- There is no open API or public mechanism for individuals to submit names directly to the IAU.

### **Implication for Stellar Provenance**
- Any naming system we create must be **symbolic**, **community‑driven**, and **non‑conflicting** with IAU standards.
- Transparency about symbolic naming is essential for scientific and public trust.

## 🛰️ 2. SkyMapper, Open Data, and Blockchain Alignment

### **SkyMapper & Data Standards**
- SkyMapper is an Australian survey telescope producing open astronomical catalogs.
- Its data is scientific, structured, and compatible with Virtual Observatory (VO) standards.
- SkyMapper does **not** publish naming data to the blockchain.
- SkyMapper’s data is **not recognized by the IAU as naming authority**, but it is recognized as a legitimate scientific dataset.

### **Blockchain Integration**
- No known project currently:
  - Takes real astronomical data  
  - Allows symbolic naming  
  - Publishes it to Ethereum  
  - Aligns metadata with scientific standards  

This creates a **clear opportunity** for Stellar Provenance.

## 🌌 3. Feasibility of a Web3 Game Using Real Astronomical Data

### **Technical Feasibility**
- Open astronomical datasets (Gaia, SkyMapper, TESS, SDSS) are:
  - Publicly accessible  
  - Scientifically validated  
  - Continuously updated  
- These datasets can be transformed into:
  - Interactive star maps  
  - Procedural exploration environments  
  - Discovery‑driven gameplay loops  

### **Blockchain Feasibility**
- Ethereum (or L2 networks) can store:
  - Symbolic naming rights  
  - Discovery timestamps  
  - Metadata hashes  
  - Community governance decisions  

### **Gameplay Potential**
A Web3 game could:
- Allow players to “discover” real celestial objects  
- Symbolically name them  
- Annotate them with lore or scientific notes  
- Earn reputation or tokens for meaningful contributions  
- Participate in citizen science missions

## 🔭 4. Scientific Value & Citizen Science Potential

### **How This Helps the Scientific Community**
A decentralized celestial registry could support science by enabling:

- **Anomaly Detection**  
  Players flag unusual objects or patterns in real datasets.

- **Data Annotation**  
  Community adds tags, classifications, or metadata.

- **Public Engagement**  
  Encourages interest in astronomy and open data.

- **Provenance Tracking**  
  Blockchain ensures transparent history of contributions.

- **Distributed Workflows**  
  Similar to Zooniverse, but with decentralized incentives.

### **Alignment with Scientific Standards**
- Use of VO-compliant metadata ensures compatibility with:
  - Astronomical databases  
  - Research tools  
  - Educational platforms

## 🧩 5. Gaps Identified in the Current Ecosystem

### **No Existing Platform Combines:**
- Real astronomical data  
- Symbolic naming  
- Blockchain provenance  
- Community governance  
- Scientific alignment  
- Gamified exploration  

This gap defines the **unique value proposition** of Stellar Provenance.

## 🚀 6. Key Conclusions

1. **IAU recognition is not possible**, but symbolic naming is viable and meaningful when transparently communicated.  
2. **No existing project** bridges astronomy, blockchain, and community governance in a scientifically aligned way.  
3. **Open astronomical data** provides a rich foundation for exploration, naming, and citizen science.  
4. **Blockchain provenance** adds transparency, ownership, and long‑term preservation.  
5. A **Web3 exploration platform** can meaningfully contribute to both public engagement and scientific workflows.  
6. There is a **clear opportunity** to build a community‑driven cosmic registry that complements, not competes with, official scientific bodies.

## 🌠 7. Implications for Stellar Provenance

These findings directly support the project’s direction:

- Build a **symbolic naming registry** with scientific metadata.  
- Use **open astronomical datasets** as the foundation for exploration.  
- Leverage **Ethereum** for provenance and governance.  
- Create a **community‑first ecosystem** blending science and storytelling.  
- Position the platform as a **citizen science enabler**, not a naming authority.
